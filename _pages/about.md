I am a qualified and Commonwealth Registered Marriage Celebrant and Master of Ceremonies located on Sydneyâ€™s beautiful Northern Beaches. Prior to commencing my celebrants journey I worked as a passionate High School Teacher moonlighting as a corporate and pub trivia host. I have a background in Sport and Exercise Science, Education and the Performing Arts, teaching Dance and Physical Education for over 10 years. 

Becoming a celebrant was a path I considered for a long time, after choregraphing several family and friends first dances and acting as the Master of Ceremonies. It was after a close friend of mine officiated my own wedding that I decided it was time to pursue this new passion so that I too could help people to craft the perfect wedding ceremony for them. 

My presentation style is bubbly, heartfelt, and assertive, delivered with experience and professionalism. My confident, flexible approach means that nothing is too difficult. With a background in teaching, I have developed strong skills in communication, allowing me to develop the perfect ceremony tailored to my clients through active listening and patience. 

I service the Greater Sydney Region, travelling to regional and interstate areas on request.
